Time & Space complexity 
Let n = number of nodes in list1, m = number in list2.


Time Complexity: 

Each node is visited exactly once (either it’s compared and appended during the loop or appended as leftover). 
The loop runs at most min(n,m) comparisons and n+m pointer moves in total. 
So time complexity = O(n + m).


Space Complexity: 

Only a constant number of extra pointers (dummy, current, and local loop temps) are used.
No new PatientRecord or Node objects are created during merge (except the dummy node). 
Therefore auxiliary space = O(1).

Total memory: The lists themselves require O(n + m) memory (existing nodes). Merge reuses them — no extra per-node memory.
